CoWin indicates that India has crossed 80 lakh daily doses only on two days in October unlike 10 such occasions in September. On October 4, first and second dose coverage reached 70.1% and 26.3% of the adult population, a 6.1 and 4.6 percentage point increase from 64% and 21.7% on September 20. But the subsequent fortnight till October 18 witnessed only a 3.9 and 3.7 percentage point increase in 1st-2nd dose coverage to 74% and 30%. Ironically, supplies are now abundant. A  whopping 10.78 crore doses lie unused with states. Instead of accelerating, vaccination coverage is slowing. The onus of incentivising recipients thus lies entirely with state governments.

As the world continues to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines remain at the forefront and the need to harness capabilities of all key stakeholders becomes vital. Starting from the cold-storage facility of the manufacturer to the administration of the vaccine, a cold chain or a temperature-controlled supply chain needs to be maintained to ensure vaccine stability and efficacy.

Apart from other changes and inducing a new normal, the pandemic underscored how the elderly needed care in the comfort of their homes. During the early days of the pandemic, the WHO identified the elderly as being at risk.

Most states now have single-dosed at least 50% of adults; Himachal became the first state to cross 50% adult coverage on both doses. Cumulative vaccination doses have also crossed 90 crore, signalling a sort of a halfway mark in vaccinations given the total adult population of 94 crore. With daily vaccination in September averaging 79 lakh, the challenge of fully vaccinating adults looks possible by early 2022.
